In this repository are upload some of the notebooks I wrote to support experiments in the context of my Master's Thesis on Data Quality and Predictive Process Monitoring.
The notebooks were mostly uploaded to provide additional visualizations that were not added to the thesis. Do not expect much in terms of explanations, although most of the notebooks have been commented to some extent.
